(2022)","text":"Parameter estimation for biological processes is often a difficult problem and depends significantly on the quality and quantity of avaiable data. We introduce a new framework which utilises Gaussian processes to discover the mechanisms underlying delay, diffusion, and reaction in a cell invasion process. Gaussian processes are leveraged with bootstrapping to provide uncertainty quantification for the mechanisms that drive the invasion process. Our framework is efficient and easily parallelisable, and can be applied to other problems. We illustrate our methods on a scratch assay experiment, demonstrating how simply we can explore different functional forms and develop and test hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, such as whether delay is present in the cell invasion process.","category":"page"},{"location":"paper.html","page":"VandenHeuvel et al.

We then fit all the models, which takes a reasonably long time to complete. We then make all the plots.","category":"page"}]
